Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply\nspend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field\nwith our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote \"home office\" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.\nRead More\nAbout Workday\nAt Workday, our employees have always been our number one Core Value.
