Your work days are brighter here.

At Workday, it all began with a conversation over breakfast. When our founders met at a sunny California diner, they came up with an idea to revolutionize the enterprise software market. And when we began to rise, one thing that really set us apart was our culture. A culture which was driven by our value of putting our people first. And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are. Our Workmates believe a healthy employee-centric, collaborative culture is the essential mix of ingredients for success in business. That’s why we look after our people, communities and the planet while still being profitable. Feel encouraged to shine, however that manifests: you don’t need to hide who you are. You can feel the energy and the passion, it's what makes us unique. Inspired to make a brighter work day for all and transform with us to the next stage of our growth journey? Bring your brightest version of you and have a brighter work day here.

About the Team

Join the Evisort team at Workday, where our mission is to transform how business deals get done. In a space often slowed by inefficient contract management systems, we provide an intelligent solution that helps businesses accelerate, scale, and safeguard operations — enabling legal and business professionals to drive strategic impact.

At Evisort, we’re building innovative AI technology that makes contracts searchable, actionable, and manageable — empowering teams to work smarter, reduce risk, and boost efficiency. By eliminating manual tasks and simplifying complex workflows, we help organizations make more confident decisions, faster.

We believe legal documents shouldn’t slow teams down. That’s why we’re reimagining contract management — removing friction and giving talented people the tools they need to thrive.

Our team shares a deep passion for Workday’s core values: innovation, integrity, and putting people first. If this sounds like your kind of team, we’d love to hear from you!

You’ll work closely with engineers, product managers, data scientists, and designers to help deliver scalable, user-centric solutions that transform how legal and business teams manage their contracts.

Your technical contributions and team-first mindset will play a key role in delivering high-impact products that scale our AI capabilities and help global organizations simplify complex business processes.

You will:

Collaborate with engineering, data science, product, and design teams to build and evolve our vision, strategy, and roadmap

Participate in a supportive, iterative team culture that values curiosity, learning, and strong engineering practices

Contribute to the growth and success of your teammates through knowledge sharing and mentorship

Our Approach to Flexible Work
 

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote "home office" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
